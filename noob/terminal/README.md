### Level 2
1. There's a hidden file in the current directory, can you find it?

2. The next file isn't as easy to find! Maybe you have to look through some hidden directories as well.

3. Even harder this time! Maybe you need an overview of the file structure.

### Level 3
1. There's a weird username on the system. Can you find it? Submit as TG17{<username>}.

2. There's a weird group name on the system. Can you find it? Submit as TG17{<groupname>}.

3. There's something weird in the kernel log. *Hint:* use grep.

2. Can you extract the contents of the zip archive?

3. Can you extract the contents of the rar archive?

### Level 5
1. Try to sort `sort.txt`!

2. Can you find the only unique word in `uniq.txt`?
