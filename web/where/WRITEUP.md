To solve this task you could google en-NR from the html.
You then find that NR is associated with The republic of Nauru.

In the js you find how the coordinates are sendt to the server,
and sends the coordinates from google maps to the server as a query-string.

This query-string would work nicely:
?lat=-0.65&lon=166.9

The server replies with the token

Token: TG17{fun_with_maps}
