In this task you get a binary.
When you run the binary it communicates with a server using a ssl connection.
You can add a new self signed cert to the system cert trust store, and then use that certificate to sniff out the token.

To solve the task run ./solve.sh

Token: TG17{thats_how_you_break_ssl}
